      "bodyText": "<p>An EV battery is designed and built to last a long time Manufacturers tend to offer warranties of around eight <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">to ten</span> years, and/or 100,000 miles – many EV batteries last twice as long.</p>\n<p>The lifespan of an EV, is as a minimum comparable with that of conventional petrol or diesel car.  Many of the first original Nissan Leaf (introduced December 2010) and Tesla model S (introduced June 2012) are on the road and going strong with incredibly high mileages.  BEV motors and drivetrains have @20 components compared to ICE engines which can have @2000 components.  Servicing requirements are vastly reduced.  BEV’s also use very little braking as battery regen systems slow the cars very effectively.</p>\n<p>As an EV battery ages, performance remains relatively similar, but the number of miles you’ll be able to travel without recharging will lessen.  This is called battery degradation but the effect is minimal.  Which magazine recently concluded a significant study, the results of which are below.</p>\n<p> <em>*Source: Latest Which? Car Survey (April 2022 to June 2022, covering the ownership experience of 58,532 cars - of which 3,262 were electric models)</em></p>\n<p>“As you might expect, newer EVs manage to maintain their range better than earlier models, with cars registered from 2019 onwards managing to deliver 98% of their original range on average.</p>\n<p>Drivers of cars that are slightly older (registered as far back as 2015) reported a slightly greater decline in the range their cars can travel (95% of the original range). There’s a more noticeable drop in the oldest electric cars we surveyed (registered in 2014), but it’s still relatively small at 9%.</p>\n<p>To put these figures into context, the average tested range for all electric cars we’ve reviewed is 188 miles. A drop of 2% would reduce this to 184 miles, while a 9% drop would result in a range of 171 miles.</p>\n<p>So, although battery degradation occurs in EVs, our data shows it’s not something you should be overly concerned about.”</p>"

      "bodyText": "<p>The distance a battery will take you between charges is generally referred to as its ‘range’.</p>\n<p>The range of an electric car varies by make and model, but you can expect to travel around 200 miles in a modern electric, car before you need to recharge.</p>\n<p>Some EVs can have a 450+ mile range, such as the Mercedes EQS.</p>\n<p>EV’s often include energy-saving features to help prolong a battery’s charge, and are worth asking the Lookers team about, when shopping for your vehicle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heat pumps that take air from around the battery which generates heat when in use, this air is used to warm the cabin so in winter, less energy is used by the traction battery to heat the cabin.</li>\n<li>A “Regenerative braking” feature charges your battery whenever you slow down, effectively the electric motors act as generators, on most cars this is adaptable and can result in “one pedal driving” where you rarely use the brakes (if you’re a careful driver!)  This reduces wear and ultimately your cost!</li>\n<li>On board vehicle pre-conditioning. This is very useful in winter when its freezing.  Provided the car is plugged into a charger it can be programmed to start heating the cabin, windows, steering wheel and seats before the journey starts so therefore not using the cars battery to make it warm safe and toasty before you set off.  This beats trying to get a freezing iced up car warm!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep an eye out for those if you’re shopping for a new electric car.</p>"
