Don’t be shy, ask around!</p>\n<p><strong>Find out if you can switch to an off-peak tariff to benefit from cheap overnight electricity. </strong></p>\n<p>Some energy companies offer tariffs that reward you for charging your EV at off-peak times, such as overnight.</p>\n<p>Switching to an Economy 7 tariff could cut the cost of your electricity bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Look out for new types of ‘smart’ off-peak tariffs, it could save you even more money. </strong></p>\n<p>Smart meters make it easier for energy suppliers to offer new types of ‘smart’ off-peak tariffs.
