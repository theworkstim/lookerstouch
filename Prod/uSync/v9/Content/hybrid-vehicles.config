      <Value><![CDATA[<p>These vehicles have an I.C.E. engine (traditional petrol or diesel) and also have an electrical power system. </p>
<p>There are two types of Hybrid vehicle – neither of which plug-in to charge, the electrical power is generated from the vehicles engine and regenerative braking systems.  Hybrids have smaller lower power batteries.</p>
<ul>
<li>MHEV’s (mild hybrid electric vehicles) The electrical system on these vehicles never powers the wheels, rather it supports the I.C.E. engine to function more efficiently by providing additional power. This makes the I.C.E. engine smoother, more powerful and most importantly more economical and with reduced emissions.</li>
<li>HEV’s (hybrid electric vehicles) Dependant on driver acceleration demands and the state of battery charge the electrical system switches with the I.C.E engine to provide drive to the wheels, hybrids have low range but work well for shorter urban journeys.</li>
</ul>]]></Value>
