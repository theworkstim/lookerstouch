      "bodyText": "<p>We think so.</p>\n<p>New electric cars and vans tend to be more expensive than petrol or diesel vehicles, but still give you the benefits of cheaper refuelling, lower tax, and lower maintenance costs.</p>\n<p>Buying a used electric vehicle can offer a best-of-both worlds solution. A reduced-price EV, with all the savings you make on the road, in tax and lower maintenance.</p>\n<p>If you’re concerned that older electric vehicles might have a reduced driving range due to battery-wear, it’s worth noting that battery decline over time tends to be fairly small, Which magazine has undertaken extensive research, in June 2022 Which reported that electric cars registered from 2015 still delivered 95% of original range, overall their conclusion was battery decline is not something to worry about.</p>\n<p>Most car manufacturers also offer warranties, some of up to eight years, guaranteeing repair or replacement if the battery capacity drops below a certain level.</p>\n<p>Check which charging cables come with your used vehicle. You’ll need a cable which is compatible with public charge-points, known as a Type 2 connector.</p>\n<p> </p>"
