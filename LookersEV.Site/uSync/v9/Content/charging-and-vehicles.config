Don’t be shy, ask around!</p>\n<p><strong>Find out if you can switch to an off-peak tariff to benefit from cheap overnight electricity. </strong></p>\n<p>Some energy companies offer tariffs that reward you for charging your EV at off-peak times, such as overnight.</p>\n<p>Switching to an Economy 7 tariff could cut the cost of your electricity bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Look out for new types of ‘smart’ off-peak tariffs, it could save you even more money. </strong></p>\n<p>Smart meters make it easier for energy suppliers to offer new types of ‘smart’ off-peak tariffs.

      "bodyText": "<p>Battery leasing has begun to decline, with advances in new battery technology for EV’s meaning few manufacturers still offer it as an option.</p>\n<p>You may still face this decision when buying an older used EV model.</p>\n<p>One advantage of leasing is that you don’t need to worry about replacing the battery if it is discovered to be faulty, or reaches the end of its life, however this necessity is extremely rare.</p>\n<p>If you do opt to lease a battery, you’ll have to pay monthly. On average, you can expect to pay between £50 and £100 per month, depending on the length of the lease, and annual mileage.</p>"

      "bodyText": "<p>Buying an electric car battery outright means there’s no monthly lease fee, and no mileage cap.</p>\n<p>On the downside, if there’s a fault after the warranty is up, you will have to pay for a new one, and the cost of having your replacement battery fitted.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, most manufacturers provide a warranty of up to <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">10 </span> 8 years, and batteries can last up to 20 years - so it’s extremely unlikely that you’ll have to pay for a new one.</p>\n<p>If you’re choosing between buying or leasing, you’ll need to look at the specific make and model, and weigh up what works best for your budget and driving styles. Consider the battery’s lifespan, and any warranty or protection schemes it comes with, against the cost of replacing it if you’d ever need to.</p>"

      "bodyText": "<p>Battery swapping, is a revolutionary alternative to cable-based recharging. Although battery swapping isn’t currently available in the UK, it is sweeping across China. Norway. Chinese manufacturer ‘Nio’ has developed battery swap stations as a fast alternative to recharging EVs. Nio has launched in Norway with battery swap stations but it is not certain of success as the cars are more expensive with a swappable battery.  The concept is also not really necessary in a relatively small country with most people able to charge at home combined with a good network of public chargers for longer journeys where you can top-up in less than 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>The UK is not very different from Norway.</p>\n<p>The swop stations carry a stock of @15 batteries plus then ones already in the cars so the overall environmental impacts of creating more batteries for stock is not great…</p>"
