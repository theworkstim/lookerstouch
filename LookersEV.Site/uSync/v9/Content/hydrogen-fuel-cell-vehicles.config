      <Value><![CDATA[<p>HFCVs are currently the least common of all electric vehicles on the road.</p>
<p>Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles feature an electric motor, which converts hydrogen gas and oxygen, into electricity.</p>
<p>The re-fuelling network for HFCV’s is not as well established in the UK, as electric battery charge-points, and this type of EV still emits emissions.</p>
<p>With HFCVs – the distances you can drive, and your re-fuelling processes, are similar to conventional cars and trucks.</p>
<p>Hydrogen is being utilised in HGV vehicles, trains and heavy construction vehicles such as earth movers as it provides electrical power with virtually the same time to refill the tank as diesel. </p>
<p>However, to produce hydrogen for fuel is inefficient, expensive and dependent on the core source (water, natural gas, oil, coal) not very environmentally friendly so it is not expected to be widely adopted for passenger car use.</p>]]></Value>
